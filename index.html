    <h2>Why AltSchool?</h2>
    <p>
      A few months before hearing about AltSchool on X(formerly Twitter), I had
      developed an interest in tech <br />
      I started learning mostly from articles and a few videos but something
      felt missing in my learning process <br />
      When I heard about AltSchool I had the belief that the school would be
      able to offer me the learning experience I was missing and therefore help
      me in pursuing a career in tech, and so I applied <br />
      Safe to say it's been a wonderful experience, albeit a few months in, It's
      been more than i expected <br />
      And I expect this journey to be a life-changing one
    </p>

    <h3>My Aim</h3>
    <p>
      I aim to have a fulfilling career in tech, become a prominent and
      established name in the world of tech and contribute to the advancement of
      society while also ushering in the technological advancements that are
      found lacking in most parts of Nigeria
